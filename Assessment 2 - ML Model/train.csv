They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish and laundry soap, provide recycled paper products, provide a water filtration pitcher to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape with native low-water plants. \n\nThe name Paper Moon comes from a popular portrait fad that began in the late 19th century. It was an inexpensive and fun way to have one’s portrait taken and paper moon booths were often set up at fairs and carnivals. We enjoy these vintage portraits which often depict folks with big grins having a good time, unlike traditional portraits of the time. As you meander from room to room in our charming cabin you’ll find vintage paper moon photos hanging on the walls. \n \nWe are confident that Paper Moon will exceed your expectations. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as providing firewood for the fire pit, and keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. You won’t want to leave Paper Moon, but you can always come back for another visit!\n\n\nPet policy:\nPets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the cabin that they be crated.

With running water, propane heat, air conditioning, fans, a water heater, a comfy bed, a microwave, wi-fi, 2 TVs, a DVD player, Firestick TV, a large closet, a gas range/oven, and all the kitchen essentials, you can hardly call it camping at all. The private bedroom has a queen size bed with a feather bed topper and a down comforter to keep you extra cozy on cold nights. The pull out couch becomes a smaller full size bed. Two children or one adult can sleep comfortably on this pull out. Nestled in the shade of ancient oak trees and a good distance from our main home, our guests will find both privacy and comfort. It is a great space for a single occupant seeking some peace and quiet, a couple seeking some alone time, travelers seeking great access to the city, or a family looking to save some money on a vacation. We can't promise you won't fall in love with Airstreams and become obsessed with finding one of your own. Please be advised that showering in a travel trailer is different than you may be accustomed to. You have to turn on the hot water about 10-20 minutes before use and you have about 10 minutes of hot water to get clean. I will leave explicit directions on how to use the shower so you can have a good experience during your stay.\n\nWe have been doing airbnb in our home and guesthouse for over 2 years. It has been a wonderful experience and we enjoy the stewardship of hosting guests from near and far.

We are accessible to our guests when they want/need it, but give you plenty of privacy. Some guests don't see us at all during their stay. I have a seamless self-check in that allows you to arrive at whatever time is convenient for you. And with airbnb messaging, I can answer your questions as they arise and in a timely manner. \n\nA bus picks up from one block away and drops you downtown or at the Pearl for $1.20.

Add that to the spacious living room with a fold-out couch, dining room with a table for 8, and the large deck with a beautiful hand-made picnic table, and you’ve got the perfect space for your family and friend retreat! At Edelweiss the owners are environmentally conscious. They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish soap, provide recycled paper products, offer a reverse-osmosis filtration system to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape minimally with native low-water plants. \n\nIf you plan to visit in the summer with children, you might also be interested in enrolling in one of the owner’s fun art classes next door. Jennifer, a TX certified art teacher, offers the best creative summer camps for small, peaceful groups in her creek side studio. Check out her offerings for kids ages 6+ at Agua Fresca Studios. \n\nWe are confident that Edelweiss will exceed your expectations. Just read some of the comments from the previous guests. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. When their chickens can keep up you’ll even find fresh, organic eggs in the fridge. You won’t want to leave Edelweiss, but you can always come back for another visit!\n\n\nPet policy:\nPets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the home that they be crated and that they remain on leash when outside the fenced yard if they might be inclined to chase a cat, chicken or child. Thanks!\n\nThis home sits on two private acres and we allow our guests as much privacy as possible. We also invite guests to explore our 10 shared acres next door, and are happy to strike up a conversation in passing. We love meeting new people!\n\nThere is a lovely creek view from the backyard, but the bank is steeper here and access down to the water is not super easy. There are multiple easy creek access points on the shared 10 acres, though. While our creek is a year 'round creek, our extended Texas drought has taken its toll on area springs and water levels can fluctuate during hot, dry spells.

Talk late into the night by the fire pit. \n\nThis 100+ yr old cabin has been revived and furnished with love. Time seems to stop while soaking in the deep old claw tub filled with endless hot spring water . Drifting to sleep, become aware of crackling in the wood burning stove, a train whistle and the trickling pond. Breakfast choices are street tacos or waffles...with pecans? \n\nIts possible you'll be tempted to stay all day.

They built a log structure on the property and replaced it in 1883 with this stone farm house.

The ranch holds a variety of wildlife, including deer, raccoons, migratory birds, and all the other native species of the Hill Country. The old field has a grove of native pecan trees. In the north end of the property (along Hasse Creek) is one of the few remaining groves of post oak trees in the county. The rest were cut down by early settlers to build the original log houses.\n\nThe town of Mason has a classic town square, centered around the county courthouse. The square continues today to be the 'hub' of the community for dining and shopping, a museum, movie theater and plenty of interesting characters! According to the Texas Monthly and the Dallas Morning news, this is the best preserved small town square in the state.\n\nThe fully equipped, modern kitchen allows guests to prepare meals in the house.

Join us in our northwest Austin home where the house is tidy, nicely decorated and we are friendly, responsible, courteous hosts. Single or couples welcome. We have two small, fairly quiet dogs and welcome travelers from all over. You can enjoy your coffee in the morning on the deck with a large backyard, or in the kitchen which is well equipped if you would like to cook a meal. Your own Parking spot can be found in front of the house on the granite gravel driveway just beside the mailbox. \n\nThe bedroom available in this listing accommodates two persons on a queen bed. It is next to my study and craft room that sometimes serves as another guest room for a family member or friend but rarely list on airbnb unless there is a huge need (SXSW, ACL, etc.). This room listing is my primary listing but wanted you to be aware of the 2nd bedroom that may be occasionally occupied by another guest. The bathroom is in the hallway and would be a shared bath with whomever stays in the 2nd guest room (if any). Otherwise, it's all yours. \n\nThe room has central air/heat and I also have a ceiling fan and a small space heater/fan for your own temperature control within the room. There is a Queen-sized bed (fresh linens, comforter and pillows provided), basic toiletries if needed, basic cable tv, a closet, desk, small microwave oven and secure wireless internet throughout the house. \n\nNearby (by car) there are plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, dry cleaners, and a mall. A nice park is within walking distance with picnic area, tennis/volleyball court and a walking trail. We have the Alamo Drafthouse movie theatre just over 2 miles away and the Lakeline Shopping Mall.\n\nTransportation: Your own vehicle transportation is probably best because of the location. MetroRail station is about 2-1/2 miles from the house if you prefer to leave your car parked in their lot and have the train take you to the heart of downtown. \n\nWe're non-smokers and prefer to host non-smokers, but if you don't mind disposing of your cigarettes properly outside, we will consider. Even though we're busy hosts we enjoy meeting new people and answering any questions. So if you're a friendly individual or at least know to say hello when you see us in the common areas, we would love to host you! \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nGravel Parking\nKitchen\n\nWe interact with our guests as little or as much as needed.\n\nQuiet neighborhood with lots of trees and good neighbors.\n\nWe are approximately 16 miles from downtown Austin. When not traveling during rush hour, I can get to downtown Austin in about 25 minutes but during rush hour, it can take up to an hour. My location makes it easier for guests with their own mode of transportation but if needed, approximately 2 miles away is the train station which will get you downtown. The bus is approximately 1.2 miles from the house but sometimes it takes over an hour and a half for the bus to make its way downtown.",Austin,1,30.4559639608887,-97.78370172423469,February 2009,1
